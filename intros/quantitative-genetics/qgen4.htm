  <A NAME="variance">Variance Components of a Quantitative Trait</A>
</H2>
<P>
As we discussed earlier, the metric value (or phenotypic value) for a specific
individual, is the result of genetic factors, environmental factors, and
the environmental factors that interact with the genetic factors. The sum
of these factors in a popul ation of individuals segregating fora quantitative
trait contributes to the variance of that population. Thus the total variance
can be partitioned in the following manner.
<P>
<B>V<SUB>P</SUB> = V<SUB>G</SUB> + V<SUB>E</SUB> + V<SUB>GE</SUB></B>
<P>
V<SUB>P</SUB> = total phenotypic variation of the segregating population<BR>
V<SUB>G</SUB> = genetic variation that contributes to the total phenotypic variation<BR>
V<SUB>E</SUB> = environmental contribution to the total phenotypic variation<BR>
V<SUB>GE</SUB> = variation associated with the genetic and environmental factor
interactions<BR>
<P>
The genetic variation can be further subdivided into three components. The
first component is called the <STRONG>additive genetic variation</STRONG>.
Some alleles may contribute a fixed value to the metric value of quantitative
value. For example, if genes A and B control corn yield (it is actually
controlled by many genes), and each allele c ontributes differently to yield
in the following manner:
<P>
A = 4 bu/ac<P>a = 2 bu/ac<P>B = 6 bu/ac<P>b = 3 bu/ac
<P>
Then the AABB genotype will have a yield of 20 (4+4+6+6) bu/ac and the AaBb
genotype will yield 15 (4+2+6+3) bu/ac. Genes that act in this manner are
additive, and they contribute to the <STRONG>additive genetic variance
(V<SUB>A</SUB>)</STRONG>.
<P>
In addition to genes which have an additive effect on the quantitative trait,
other genes may exhibit a dominant gene action which will mask the contribution
of the recessive alleles at the locus. For example, if the two genes just
mentioned exhibited dominance the metric value of the AaBb heterozygote would
be 20 bu/ac. This value equals the homozygous dominant genotype in the example
where the alleles were acting additively. This source of variability is
attributed to the <STRONG>dominance genetic variance (V<SUB>D</SUB>)</STRONG>.
<P>
The final type of genetic variance is associated with the interactions between
genes. The genetic basis of this variance is epistasis, and it is called
the <STRONG>interaction genetic variance (V<SUB>I</SUB>)</STRONG>.
<P>
The total genetic variance can be partitioned into the three forms of variance
<P>
<B>V<SUB>G</SUB> = V<SUB>A</SUB> + V<SUB>D</SUB> + V<SUB>I</SUB></B>
<P>
and the total phenotypic variance can be rewritten as
<P>
<B>V<SUB>P</SUB> = V<SUB>A</SUB> + V<SUB>D</SUB> + V<SUB>I</SUB> + V<SUB>E</SUB> + V<SUB>GE</SUB></B>
<P>
By performing specific experiments quantitative geneticists can estimate
the proportion of the total variance that is attributable to the total genetic
variance and the environmental genetic variance. If geneticists are trying
to improve a specific quantitative trait (such as crop yield or weight gain
of an animal), estimates of the proportion of these variances to the total
variance provide direction to their research. If a large portion of the variance
is genetic, then gains can be made from selecting individuals with the metric
value you wish to obtain. On the other hand if the genetic variance is low,
which implies that the envi ronmental variance is high, more success would
be obtained if the environmental conditions under which the individual will
be grown are optimized.
