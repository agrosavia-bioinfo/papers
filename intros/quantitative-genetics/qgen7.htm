  Predicting Response to Selection
</H2>
<P>
Another use of heritability is to determine how a population will respond
to selection. Typically parents with the phenotypic value of interest are
selected from a base population. These parents are crossed, and a new
population is developed. The following distributions illustrate this
point.

The selection differential is the difference of the base population mean
and the mean of the selected parents. The selection response is how much
gain you make when mating the selected parents. Remember, the narrow sense
heritability is a measure of the genetic component that is contributed by
the additive genetic variance. The response to selection can thus be dervied
by multiply the heriability by the selection differntial. The following example
illustrates how we can predict the response to selection.
<P>
The base sunflower population has a mean of 100 days to flowering. Two parents
were selected that had a mean of 90 days to flowering. The quantitative trait
days to flowering has a heritability of 0.2. What would be the mean of a
population derived from crossing these two parents.
<P>
R = h<SUP>2</SUP>S<BR>
R = 0.2(90 - 100) days to flowering<BR>
R = -2 days
<P>
The new population mean would therefore be 98 days to flowering (100 days - 2 days).
