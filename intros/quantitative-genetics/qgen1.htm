  Description of Quantitative Traits
</H2>
<P>
All of the traits that we have studied to date fall into a few distinct classes.
These classes can be used to predict the genotypes of the individuals. For
example, if we cross a tall and short pea plant and look at F<SUB>2</SUB> plants, we
know the genotype of s hort plants, and we can give a generalized genotype
for the tall plant phenotype. Furthermore, if we know the genotype we could
predict the phenotype of the plant. These type of phenotypes are called
<STRONG>discontinuous traits</STRONG>.
<P>
Other traits do not fall into discrete classes. Rather, when a segregating
population is analyzed, a continuous distribution of phenotypes is found.
An example, is ear length in corn. Black Mexican Sweet corn has short ears,
whereas Tom Thumb popcorn has long ears. When these two inbred lines are
crossed, the length of the F<SUB>1</SUB> ears are intermediate to the two parents.
Furthermore, when the F<SUB>1</SUB> plants are intermated, the distribution of ear length
in the F<SUB>2</SUB> ranges from the short ear Black Mexican Sweet size to the Tom Thumb
popcorn size. The distribution resembles the bell-shaped curve for a normal
distribution.
<P>
These types of traits are called <STRONG>continuous traits</STRONG> and cannot
be analyzed in the same manner as discontinuous traits. Because continuous
traits are often measured and given a quantitative value, they are often
referred to as <STRONG>quantitative traits</STRONG>, and the area of genetics
that studies their mode of inheritance is called <STRONG>quantitative
genetics</STRONG>.
<P>
Many important agricultural traits such as crop yield, weight gain in animals,
fat content of meat are quantitative traits, and much of the pioneering research
into the modes of inheritance of these traits was performed by agricultural
geneticists. Many human phenotypes such as IQ, learning ability and blood
pressure also are quantitative traits. <STRONG>These traits are controlled
by multiple genes, each segregating according to Mendel's laws. These traits
can also be affected by the environment to varying degrees</STRONG>.
<P>
The following are examples of quantitative traits that we are concerned with
in our daily life.

Here are some images of quantitative traits in plants:

This image demonstrates the variation for flower diameter, number of flower
parts and the color of the flower <EM>Gaillaridia pilchella</EM>. Each trait
is controlled by a number of genes and is a quantitative trait.

The two photographs above demonstrate variability for Indian Paintbrush flower
color. The parents in the left photo are either yellow or reddish orange.
The F<SUB>2</SUB> individuals though show a distribution of colors from yellow to reddish
orange. This range o f phenotypes is typcial of quantitative traits. This
should be compared to flower color of Mendel's peas where the F<SUB>2</SUB> individuals
were either purple or white, the two parental phenotypes.<P>
